Forecasting Climate Change Experiences

This Github repository has been created to share files associated with an XR application designed
to help students learn and understand the impacts of climate change. 

This project is made possible with funding by the Government of Ontario and through
eCampusOntarioâ€™s support of the Virtual Learning Strategy. To learn more about the Virtual
Learning Strategy visit: https://vls.ecampusontario.ca

Stay tuned for ongoing updates as we continue to build resources in support of 
better understanding the wicked challenges we face together.
